abstract = "In order to solve the problem of motion when in contact with the environment and force applied during the operation of industrial robots, an adaptive trajectory tracking system based on impedance control is proposed. Firstly, the feasibility of using impedance control to solve the problem is analyzed theoretically, and the concrete realization method of impedance control is put forward. The stability condition of the control system is analyzed from the perspective of discrete system. Secondly, a joint simulation platform is set up based on SolidWorks and MATLAB/SimMechanics, and the feasibility of the program is verified through simulation. Finally, a physical experiment platform based on Estun ER16 industrial robots, EtherCAT bus controllers, optoforce six-axis force / torque sensors and ATI anti-collision sensors was constructed to further validate this scheme. The experimental results show that the robot can adaptively change the trajectory when it is subjected to external force, and then return to the original trajectory to continue the motion after the external force disappears, which proves the feasibility and validity of the scheme."
